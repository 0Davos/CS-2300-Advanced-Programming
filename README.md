# CS-120-Advanced-Programming

This is a Repository for UVM CS 120 Advanced Programming class. The goal of this class is to explore pull request and issues in a group on a single repository.  

Steps 
1. One member of the group will create a template copy of this repository and share the url with the rest of the group
2. In the browser add 3 comments to one of the program files of your choosing (check with others in your group to prevent merge conflicts) and submit a pull request. The repo owner then will need to accept each pull request from the team
3. Select another program file and create 5 seperate issues using the Issue/Bug Template below
4. Now have the repo owner invite all of the team as contributors
5. Choose a program file you have not worked on yet and try to solve all the bug issues for that file. 
6. Submit a pull request for each bug fix
7. Add comments about your fix to the issue
8. Go to the program file you submitted bug reports for and review the fixes to verify they work, if they do, accept the pull request and close the bug with a note
